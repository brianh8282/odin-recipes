        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This French toast recipe is different because it uses flour. I have given it to some 
            friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>12 thick slices bread</li>
        </ul>
