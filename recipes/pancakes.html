            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk with vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour".</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk egg and 
                butter into "soured" milk. Pour the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk until lumps

            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the 
                skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned 
                on the other side.</li>
